Project 4 
---------

This is project 4 of the udacity nanodegree course. The project is about building a joke-telling app, factoring functionality into libraries and flavors to keep the build simple. Also Google cloud endpoints development server is configured to supply the jokes.

The test case provided as connectedTest can be run directly from gradle. The task 'inititialzeTestCases' starts the dev server, runs the connectedTest which checks if the string returned from the library is empty or not and finally closes the server. To run the task, just execute the "gradle initializeTestCases" from the gradle command line.
